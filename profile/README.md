# SmartHaus Group

**Mathematics as the Nervous System of AI.**

SmartHaus builds **compound AI systems** where every interaction is governed by formal models of control, memory, and intent. We replace "vibe coding" and black-box guesswork with deterministic, field-native architectures.

> "The system owns the structure; the model operates within it."

## 🏗️ The Archetypes

SmartHaus defines two primary archetypes for AI systems, each built on our shared mathematical substrate.

### 1. **TAI** (Tutelarius Auxilium Intellectus)
**The Personal Assistant Layer.**
TAI sits between the user/developer and the AI ecosystem, acting as a sovereign orchestrator. It is not just an agent; it is the interface layer that manages intent, memory, and execution.

**Core Services (Standalone or Integrated):**
- **MAIA** (Mathematical AI Intent Analyzer): Intent classification & field measurement.
- **CAIO** (Control AI Orchestrator): Deterministic routing and governance.
- **RFS** (Resonant Field Storage): Field-native memory substrate.
- **NME** (Narrative Memory Engine): Narrative construction and trait extraction.
- **VFE** (Verbum Field Engine): Deterministic inference engine.
- **VEE** (Variational Evidence Estimator): Probabilistic truth estimation.

### 2. **AIVA** (Artificialis Intelligentia Vivens Anima)
**The Living System.**
AIVA is a triadic architecture designed for autonomous, self-evolving intelligence.

**The Triad:**
- **AiOS:** The Biological Layer (Cognition & Homeostasis).
- **LQL:** The Chemical Layer (Language & Reaction).
- **LEF:** The Physical Layer (Execution & Energy).

## 🛡️ Governance

- **MGE** (Mathematical Governance Engine): A standalone sidecar for **Mathematical Autopsy**. It enforces rules, invariants, and compliance across all systems (TAI or AIVA) but is distinct from the operational layers.

## 📜 The Philosophy

We adhere to a **Math-First** engineering doctrine:
1.  **Determinism:** Replace probabilistic coin-flips with calculated utilities.
2.  **Invariants:** Enforce safety constraints physically within the control logic.
3.  **Conservation:** Treat information state like energy—never lost, always accounted for.
