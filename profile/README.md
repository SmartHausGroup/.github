**Mathematics as the Nervous System of AI.**

SMARTHAUS builds **compound AI systems** where every interaction is governed by formal models of control, memory, and intent. We replace "vibe coding" and black-box guesswork with deterministic, field-native architectures.

> "The system owns the structure; the model operates within it."

## 🔬 Mathematical Autopsy (The Methodology)

Before a single line of code is written, we apply **Mathematical Autopsy (MA)**. This is not just debugging; it is a forensic dissection of the problem space to derive the mathematical truths that must govern the solution.

We treat software engineering like physics: **derive the laws first, then build the universe.**

### The 5-Phase Process
Every SMARTHAUS system must pass through this rigorous pipeline:

1.  **Phase 1: Intent & Description** — What is the problem? Define success criteria in plain English.
2.  **Phase 2: Mathematical Foundation** — Define the operators, equations, and complexity limits.
3.  **Phase 3: Lemma Development** — Create formal YAML invariants (`INV-001`) and logical lemmas.
4.  **Phase 4: Verification (Notebook-First)** — Prove the math in executable notebooks. **No production code exists yet.**
5.  **Phase 5: CI Enforcement** — Lock the invariants into the CI/CD pipeline via **MGE**.

**Only after Phase 5 is the "Production Code" written.** This ensures that our systems are correct by design, not by accident.

## 🏗️ The Archetypes

SMARTHAUS defines two primary archetypes for AI systems, each built on our shared mathematical substrate.

### 1. **TAI** (Tutelarius Auxilium Intellectus)
**The Personal Assistant Layer.**
TAI sits between the user/developer and the AI ecosystem, acting as a sovereign orchestrator. It is not just an agent; it is the interface layer that manages intent, memory, and execution.

**Core Services (Standalone or Integrated):**
- **MAIA** (Mathematical AI Intent Analyzer): Intent classification & field measurement.
- **CAIO** (Control AI Orchestrator): Deterministic routing and governance.
- **RFS** (Resonant Field Storage): Field-native memory substrate. **(Production Ready - NVIDIA Inception Accelerated)**
- **NME** (Narrative Memory Engine): Narrative construction and trait extraction.
- **VFE** (Verbum Field Engine): Deterministic inference engine.
- **VEE** (Variational Evidence Estimator): Probabilistic truth estimation.

### 2. **AIVA** (Artificialis Intelligentia Vivens Anima)
**The Living System.**
AIVA is a triadic architecture designed for autonomous, self-evolving intelligence.

**The Triad:**
- **AiOS:** The Biological Layer (Cognition & Homeostasis).
- **LQL:** The Chemical Layer (Language & Reaction).
- **LEF:** The Physical Layer (Execution & Energy).

## 🛡️ Governance

- **MGE** (Mathematical Governance Engine): A standalone sidecar for **Mathematical Autopsy**. It is the enforcer. MGE ingests the invariants from Phase 3 and blocks any action that violates the mathematical laws of the system.

## 📜 The Philosophy

We adhere to a **Math-First** engineering doctrine:
1.  **Determinism:** Replace probabilistic coin-flips with calculated utilities.
2.  **Invariants:** Enforce safety constraints physically within the control logic.
3.  **Conservation:** Treat information state like energy—never lost, always accounted for.
