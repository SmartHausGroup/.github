# SmartHaus Group

**Building the future of intelligent systems through mathematical rigor**

SmartHaus Group is a technology organization developing advanced AI systems, frameworks, and platforms with a foundation in mathematical precision and governance-by-design. We follow the **Mathematical Autopsy** methodology: every system begins with documentation, formalizes mathematics, establishes lemmas and invariants, validates through executable notebooks, and culminates in traceable, secure, and governed code.

## 🎯 Our Approach: Mathematical Autopsy

We build systems through a rigorous, math-first methodology:

1. **Documentation** → Define problem, outcomes, and guardrails
2. **Mathematics** → Formalize operators, calculus, and proofs
3. **Lemmas** → Establish mathematical guarantees
4. **Invariants** → Define runtime constraints and validation gates
5. **Notebooks** → Executable verification and validation
6. **Code** → Implementation traceable to mathematical foundations

This ensures every system is **traceable, secure, and governed by design**—not retrofitted.

## 🏗️ What We Build

### 📐 Advisory: AI Development Framework

**Mathematical Autopsy** - Our foundational methodology for building mathematically rigorous systems. A doc-first, determinism-driven approach with CI gates, artifacts, and scorecard validation.

**AIDF (AI Development Framework)** - A mathematically grounded framework combining formal reasoning (sequent calculus, operational semantics) with optimization and governance math. Transforms how organizations build, validate, and deploy AI systems.

**Key Projects:**
- **[MathematicalAutopsy](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/MathematicalAutopsy)** - Methodology and framework
- **[AIDF](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/AIDF)** - AI Development Framework

### ⚛️ Systems: Core Technologies

**RFS (Resonant Field Storage)** - A holographic memory substrate that stores documents as superposed wave patterns in a 4-D field. Retrieves information through resonance rather than traditional indexing. Features Metal acceleration, mathematical guardrails, and AEAD-backed exact recall.

**VFE (VerbumFieldEngine)** - GPU-first model inference engine with calculus-based model selection. Optimizes cost, privacy, alignment, and capacity constraints. Supports Metal, CUDA, and ROCm acceleration.

**QuantumCore** - Native C++ quantum compute engine providing high-performance numerics for orchestrators. Exposes eigen/spectral operations with optional HTTP service layer.

**Key Projects:**
- **[ResonantFieldStorage](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/ResonantFieldStorage)** - Holographic memory system
- **[VerbumFieldEngine](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/VerbumFieldEngine)** - GPU-accelerated inference engine
- **[QuantumCore](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/QuantumCore)** - Quantum compute engine

### 🚀 Platforms: Integrated Systems

**TAI (Triadic AI)** - Platform that integrates core systems (RFS, VFE, QuantumCore, Holographic Memory) into unified services. Provides enterprise-grade orchestration, security, and governance.

**AIVA (AI Virtual Architecture)** - Comprehensive platform built on the LATTICE ecosystem:
- **LEF (Lattice Execution Fabric)** - Physics layer: particle-based execution engine that compiles symbolic instructions to native machine code
- **LQL (Lattice Query Language)** - Chemistry layer: declarative query language transforming intent into mathematically provable execution graphs (DAGs)
- **AIOS/COE (Cognitive Orchestration Engine)** - Biology layer: intelligence system with symbolic cognition, brain regions (Prefrontal Cortex, Hippocampus, Amygdala, etc.), and intent-driven orchestration

**Key Projects:**
- **[TAI](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/TAI)** - Integrated platform
- **[AIVA](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/AIVA)** - LATTICE ecosystem platform
- **[LEF](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/LEF)** - Execution fabric
- **[LQL](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/LQL)** - Query language
- **[AIOS](https://github.com/SmartHausGroup/AIOS)** - Cognitive orchestration
