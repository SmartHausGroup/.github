# SmartHaus Group

**Mathematics as the Nervous System of AI.**

SmartHaus builds **compound AI systems** where every interaction is governed by formal models of control, memory, and intent. We replace "vibe coding" and black-box guesswork with deterministic, field-native architectures.

> "The system owns the structure; the model operates within it."

## 🏗️ The Architecture

Our stack is built on a shared mathematical substrate, ensuring that disparate AI components operate as a coherent system.

| Component | Name | Role | Type |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| **🧠 TAI** | **Tutelarius Auxilium Intellectus** | The Cognitive Orchestrator | *Agentic System* |
| **🌌 RFS** | **Resonant Field Storage** | Memory as a Topological Field | *Storage Substrate* |
| **⚡ VFE** | **Verbum Field Engine** | Deterministic Inference | *Compute Engine* |
| **🛡️ MGE** | **Mathematical Governance Engine** | Compliance Sidecar | *Governance* |

## 📜 The Philosophy

We adhere to a **Math-First** engineering doctrine:
1.  **Determinism:** Replace probabilistic coin-flips with calculated utilities.
2.  **Invariants:** Enforce safety constraints physically within the control logic.
3.  **Conservation:** Treat information state like energy—never lost, always accounted for.
