# SmartHaus Group

**Building the future of intelligent systems through mathematical rigor**

SmartHaus Group is a technology organization developing advanced AI systems, frameworks, and platforms with a foundation in mathematical precision and governance-by-design. We follow the **Mathematical Autopsy** methodology: every system begins with documentation, formalizes mathematics, establishes lemmas and invariants, validates through executable notebooks, and culminates in traceable, secure, and governed code.

## 🎯 Our Approach: Mathematical Autopsy

We build systems through a rigorous, math-first methodology:

1. **Documentation** → Define problem, outcomes, and guardrails
2. **Mathematics** → Formalize operators, calculus, and proofs
3. **Lemmas** → Establish mathematical guarantees
4. **Invariants** → Define runtime constraints and validation gates
5. **Notebooks** → Executable verification and validation
6. **Code** → Implementation traceable to mathematical foundations

This ensures every system is **traceable, secure, and governed by design**—not retrofitted.

## 🏗️ What We Build

### 📐 Advisory: AI Development Framework

**Mathematical Autopsy** - Our foundational methodology for building mathematically rigorous systems. A doc-first, determinism-driven approach with CI gates, artifacts, and scorecard validation.

**AIDF (AI Development Framework)** - A mathematically grounded framework combining formal reasoning (sequent calculus, operational semantics) with optimization and governance math. Transforms how organizations build, validate, and deploy AI systems.

**Key Projects:**
- **MathematicalAutopsy** - Methodology and framework
- **AIDF** - AI Development Framework

### ⚛️ Systems: Core Technologies

**RFS (Resonant Field Storage)** - A holographic memory substrate that stores documents as superposed wave patterns in a 4-D field. Retrieves information through resonance rather than traditional indexing. Features Metal acceleration, mathematical guardrails, and AEAD-backed exact recall. **RFS runs locally on edge devices, preserving data privacy by keeping all data on-device.**

**VFE (VerbumFieldEngine)** - GPU-first model inference engine with calculus-based model selection. Optimizes cost, privacy, alignment, and capacity constraints. Supports Metal, CUDA, and ROCm acceleration. **VFE runs locally on edge devices, ensuring sensitive data never leaves the user's hardware.**

**QuantumCore** - Native C++ quantum compute engine providing high-performance numerics for orchestrators. Exposes eigen/spectral operations with optional HTTP service layer.

**Key Projects:**
- **ResonantFieldStorage** - Holographic memory system
- **VerbumFieldEngine** - GPU-accelerated inference engine
- **QuantumCore** - Quantum compute engine

### 🚀 Platforms: Integrated Systems

**TAI (Tutelarius Auxilium Intellectus - Guardian of Intelligent Assistance)** - A modular Personal Assistant platform that enables plug-and-play integration of AI modules and capabilities. TAI provides a flexible architecture where core systems (RFS, VFE, QuantumCore) integrate seamlessly as modules. The vision is to create a marketplace ecosystem where developers can build and distribute modules that extend TAI's capabilities, similar to an app store for AI assistants. RFS and VFE modules run locally on edge devices, preserving user data privacy while enabling powerful AI capabilities.

**AIVA (Artificialis Intelligentia Vivens Anima - Artificial Intelligence Living Soul)** - An intent-to-execution system built on the LATTICE ecosystem. AIVA takes natural language intent and automatically decomposes it into executable workflows through three specialized layers:
- **AIOS (Artificial Intelligence Operating System)** - Intelligence layer: symbolic cognition, brain regions (Prefrontal Cortex, Hippocampus, Amygdala, etc.), and intent-driven orchestration
- **LQL (Lattice Query Language)** - Chemistry layer: declarative query language transforming intent into mathematically provable execution graphs (DAGs)
- **LEF (Lattice Execution Fabric)** - Physics layer: particle-based execution engine that compiles symbolic instructions to native machine code

AIVA enables users to specify their intent in natural language, and the system automatically creates, optimizes, and proves the correctness of the resulting program with built-in governance, traceability, and security.

**Key Projects:**
- **TAI** - Modular Personal Assistant platform
- **AIVA** - LATTICE ecosystem platform
- **AIOS** - Artificial Intelligence Operating System
- **LEF** - Execution fabric
- **LQL** - Query language
