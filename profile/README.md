**SMARTHAUS** is an advisory and research organization building deterministic AI through mathematics.

## What is SMARTHAUS?

We are founded on one positioning:

- **Advisory-ready:** We offer client-facing strategic services built on Mathematical Autopsy.
- **Research-driven:** We develop mathematical methods and systems that reduce uncertainty.
- **Product-in-development:** TAI, AIVA, RFS, and MGE are our current engineering workstreams, not claims of production availability.

### The Problem

Modern AI is often non-deterministic. Teams rely on testing and heuristics and still face edge cases they cannot predict.

### The Solution

We replace “trust me” systems with methods that are:

- **Mathematically defined**
- **Invariant-enforced**
- **Continuously verified**

## Advisory Positioning

SMARTHAUS is first and foremost advisory and research. Our consultancy-style offerings help teams move from unclear AI outcomes to auditable, reproducible systems.

## What we build (in development)

- **TAI** — a deterministic-assurance personal AI system under active development.
- **AIVA** — a triadic systems architecture in development.
- **MGE** — a governance engine that turns invariants into execution policy.
- **RFS** — a mathematical memory substrate and research foundation.

## Core Principles

1. **Proof before implementation**
   - We define the governing formula and constraints before code.
2. **Verifiable outcomes**
   - Clients get a clear path from intent to proof to execution.
3. **Deterministic behavior**
   - Same inputs and fixed context should produce the same outcome.
