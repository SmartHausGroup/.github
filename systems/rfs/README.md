## Overview

Resonant Field Storage (RFS) is a revolutionary approach to information storage and retrieval that treats memory as a mathematical field rather than a database. Instead of storing documents in tables and building indexes, RFS stores everything as superposed wave patterns in a shared 4-dimensional field and retrieves information through resonance.

**Core Innovation**: RFS implements a resonant field representation using standard digital signal processing (DSP) — Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) and wavelets — and controlled superposition. The value comes from the operational guardrails and mathematical guarantees layered on top.

## What Makes RFS Different?

### Traditional Systems
- Documents stored separately
- Indexes built separately  
- Relationships must be explicitly defined
- Black-box search results
- No explainability
- O(N) storage complexity

### RFS Approach
- **All documents superposed in one field** — N documents stored in O(D) space, not O(N)
- **Relationships emerge automatically** through interference patterns
- **Resonance-based retrieval** — not keyword matching, but semantic resonance
- **Explainable results** with interference patterns showing why documents are related
- **Mathematical guarantees** for correctness, determinism, and energy conservation
- **Dual query paths** — fast simple search or rich field-native search on the same field

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Superposition
All documents are stored together in a single 4D field `(x, y, z, t)`. This means:
- **Space Efficiency**: N documents stored in O(D) space, not O(N)
- **Automatic Relationships**: Documents interact and create interference patterns
- **Unified Storage**: One field, not separate indexes
- **Temporal Dimension**: Track evolution over time (4th dimension)

### 2. Resonance Search
Queries work by exciting resonances in the field:
- **Semantic Matching**: Finds meaning, not just keywords
- **Fast Retrieval**: Parallel FFT operations enable rapid search
- **Relationship Discovery**: Automatically finds related documents
- **Unified Query System**: Choose `query_simple()` for fast cosine similarity (>1000 QPS) or `query()` for full field-native features (200-300+ QPS) on the same field

### 3. Interference Patterns
Wave interference reveals information:
- **Constructive Interference**: Documents that reinforce each other (relationships, analogies)
- **Destructive Interference**: Documents that contradict (tensions, contradictions)
- **Explainability**: Interference patterns explain why results were returned
- **Quantified Metrics**: Q (resonance clarity), η (destructive energy ratio)

### 4. Exact Recall
AEAD-backed byte channel ensures:
- **Perfect Reconstruction**: Exact bytes recovered, not approximations
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic guarantees for authenticity
- **Audit Trail**: Complete provenance for compliance
- **Dual Fidelity**: Associative (fast, approximate) and recall (exact, bounded-error) modes

### 5. Mathematical Guarantees
Every operation is mathematically proven:
- **42+ Invariants**: Validated in continuous integration
- **60+ Verification Notebooks**: Executable proofs with deterministic execution
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Energy Conservation**: All operations preserve mathematical properties (Parseval's theorem)
- **Formal Proofs**: Lemmas and theorems document every guarantee

## Architecture

### The 4D Field Lattice

RFS maintains a **4-dimensional complex tensor**:

$$\Psi(x, y, z, t) \in \mathbb{C}$$

**Why 4D?**
- **Three spatial dimensions** `(x, y, z)`: Allow documents to occupy distinct "locations" in the field, enabling spatial multiplexing and interference patterns that encode semantic relationships
- **One temporal dimension** `(t)`: Enables recency weighting, memory consolidation, temporal context, and decay dynamics

### Architectural Stack

1. **Field Dynamics Layer** — Maintains the complex amplitude/phase field in GPU memory
2. **Field-Native Semantic Encoding Layer** — Maps tokens/features into waveform primitives
3. **Resonance Query & Retrieval Layer** — Unified field with dual query paths (`query_simple()` and `query()`)
4. **Ops, Integrity & Governance Layer** — Metadata, persistence, snapshots, WAL, guardrails

### Unified Query System

**One field, two query paths:**

- **`query_simple()`**: Fast cosine similarity on preserved document vectors
  - O(N) complexity
  - <1ms p95 latency
  - >1000 QPS
  - Simple semantic search without field-native features

- **`query()`**: Full field-native resonance search
  - O(C D log D) complexity
  - 5-50ms latency
  - 200-300+ QPS
  - Interference patterns, relationship discovery, explainability

Both paths operate on the same underlying field and vectors, ensuring consistency and eliminating duplicate storage.

## Key Benefits

## Use Cases

RFS excels in scenarios where relationships, explainability, and exact recall matter:

1. **Incident Memory for On-Call Teams** — Automatically discover related incidents and patterns
2. **RAG with Proofs** — Explainable document selection for LLM context
3. **Code Intelligence** — Find code analogies and patterns automatically
4. **Compliance/Legal Archive** — Audit-ready document relationships with exact recall
5. **Research Knowledge Graph** — Track concept evolution and research communities

See [Use Cases](./use-cases/) for detailed documentation on each scenario.

## Development Methodology

RFS follows **notebook-first development** as part of the Mathematical Autopsy (MA) process:

1. **Math & Documentation** — Define intent, mathematical foundations, lemmas, and invariants
2. **Notebook Implementation** — Write implementation code directly in notebooks
3. **Validation** — Test code against lemmas/invariants, generate artifacts
4. **Code Extraction** — Extract validated code from notebooks to codebase
5. **Verification** — Verify extracted code matches math

**Critical Order**: Math → Invariants → Code (NEVER Code → Math)
