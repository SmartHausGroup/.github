# RFS Use Cases — White Papers

**Status:** Public Documentation  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-11

## Overview

This directory contains white paper documentation for six high-value use cases demonstrating Resonant Field Storage (RFS) capabilities. Each use case is presented as an educational white paper focusing on problems, solutions, and business value rather than implementation details.

## Use Cases

### 1. Incident Memory for On-Call Teams
**Directory:** `01_incident_memory_oncall/`  
**Problem:** On-call engineers struggle to find related incidents quickly; current keyword search misses relationships  
**RFS Solution:** Superposition + interference patterns automatically discover related incidents, contradictions, and patterns  
**Key Value:** Reduced MTTR, automatic pattern detection, explainable incident relationships

### 2. RAG with Proofs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**Directory:** `02_rag_with_proofs/`  
**Problem:** LLMs need context but current systems can't prove why documents were selected  
**RFS Solution:** Resonance-based document selection with interference pattern explanations  
**Key Value:** Explainable AI, better context selection, compliance-ready citations

### 3. Code Intelligence
**Directory:** `03_code_intelligence/`  
**Problem:** Developers need to find similar code patterns; keyword search misses analogies  
**RFS Solution:** Field-native search discovers code analogies, patterns, and contradictions  
**Key Value:** Faster development, code reuse, pattern discovery

### 4. Compliance/Legal Archive
**Directory:** `04_compliance_legal_archive/`  
**Problem:** Legal teams need to find related documents and prove relationships for evidence  
**RFS Solution:** Relationship discovery + exact byte recall (AEAD-verified) with explainable connections  
**Key Value:** Faster legal research, audit-ready explanations, exact recall for evidence

### 5. Research Knowledge Graph
**Directory:** `05_research_knowledge_graph/`  
**Problem:** Researchers need to find related papers and understand how concepts evolved over time  
**RFS Solution:** Temporal field dimension tracks evolution; entanglement graph shows research communities  
**Key Value:** Knowledge discovery, temporal analysis, research community mapping

## Quick Comparison

| Use Case | Primary RFS Feature | Key Differentiator | Enterprise Value |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Incident Memory | Superposition + Interference | Automatic relationship discovery | Reduced MTTR, pattern detection |
| RAG with Proofs | Resonance + Explainability | Provable document selection | Explainable AI, compliance |
| Code Intelligence | Field-native search | Analogy discovery | Faster dev, code reuse |
| Legal Archive | Relationships + Exact Recall | Explainable connections + AEAD | Audit-ready, faster research |
| Research Graph | Temporal + Entanglement | Evolution tracking + communities | Knowledge discovery |

## Common RFS Capabilities Used

All use cases leverage core RFS features:

1. **Superposition**: All documents in one field (not isolated)
2. **Interference Patterns**: Constructive (relationships) and destructive (contradictions)
3. **Resonance Search**: Query field resonates with superposed field
4. **Explainability**: Interference patterns explain why results were returned
5. **Exact Recall**: AEAD-verified byte retrieval (where applicable)
6. **Temporal Dimension**: Track evolution over time (where applicable)
7. **Entanglement Graph**: Relationship mapping (where applicable)
