# AEF — AIVA Execution Fabric

**Physics layer of AIVA: particle-based execution engine**

Part of the **AIVA** archetype. [← Back to AIVA](../README.md)

## Role

AEF is the **Physics layer** of the triadic AIVA system. It compiles and runs AQL particle instructions: quantum-inspired execution, energy-based resource management, and built-in telemetry.

## Architecture

**Particle types**:

- **Quarks** — Core computation
- **Leptons** — I/O operations
- **Bosons** — Communication/messaging
- **Gluons** — Binding/synchronization
- **Neutrinos** — Silent/monitoring

## Key features

- Quantum-like computation on classical hardware
- Superposition and entanglement simulation
- Energy-based resource management
- Built-in telemetry and observability
- A/B testing for optimization

## Integration

- **RFS** — Execution state and telemetry
- **AQL** — DAGs compiled to particle instructions, executed by AEF
- **AIOS** — Execution telemetry fed back to AIOS for learning
