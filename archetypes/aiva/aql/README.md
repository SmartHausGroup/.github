# AQL — AIVA Query Language

**Chemistry layer of AIVA: symbolic query language and provable execution graphs**

Part of the **AIVA** archetype. [← Back to AIVA](../README.md)

## Role

AQL is the **Chemistry layer** of the triadic AIVA system. It transforms intent into mathematically provable execution graphs (DAGs): molecules, atoms, chemical bonds, and equilibrium (proofs).

## Key features

- **Static deterministic graphs** — DAGs ensure mathematical correctness and provability
- **Symbolic contract resolution** — Formal specification of computational intent
- **Mathematical proof system** — Formal verification of correctness
- **Type safety** — Guaranteed contract resolution properties
- **Compile-time optimization** — DAG performance optimization

## Mathematical foundation

- Contract Resolution Operator, Intent-Driven Structural Calculus (IDSC), Mutation Differential Operator (MDO), Entropy Axioms

## Integration

- **RFS** — Stores symbolic structures and contracts
- **AIOS** — Intent parsed by AIOS is compiled to AQL DAGs
- **AEF** — AQL DAGs are compiled to particle instructions and executed by AEF
