# NME — Nota Memoria Engine

**Memory structuring and trait extraction before RFS**

Part of the **TAI** archetype. [← Back to TAI](../README.md)

## Role

NME (Nota Memoria Engine) structures memory and extracts traits before data is stored in RFS. It supports persona traits (preferences, personality, communication style) and memory organization for TAI’s endless recall.

## Integration

- **RFS** — Feeds structured memory and traits into the 4D field
- **TAI** — Used by the personal assistant for learning and personalization
- **VEE / VFE** — Can integrate with intent and inference pipelines

Some TAI components may align with or become parts of the COE (Cognitive Orchestration Engine) in AIVA’s biology layer.
