# MAIA

**Attention mechanisms and intent processing**

Part of the **TAI** archetype. [← Back to TAI](../README.md)

## Role

MAIA provides attention mechanisms and intent processing. It routes and focuses TAI’s reasoning: attention over context, intent decomposition, and connection to VFE, RFS, and the marketplace.

## Integration

- **TAI** — Core attention and intent for the personal assistant
- **VFE** — Model selection and inference
- **VEE** — Intent classification pipeline
- **RFS** — Context and memory for attention

Some TAI components may align with or become parts of the COE (Cognitive Orchestration Engine) in AIVA’s biology layer.
