# VEE — Voluntas Engine

**Intent classification and quantum-inspired math**

Part of the **TAI** archetype. [← Back to TAI](../README.md)

## Role

VEE (Voluntas Engine) handles intent classification and quantum-inspired mathematics. It supports TAI’s understanding of user goals and routes to the right actions and models.

## Integration

- **TAI** — Intent and routing for the personal assistant
- **MAIA** — Attention mechanisms and intent processing
- **VFE** — Inference selection based on intent
- **NME** — Memory and traits for context

Some TAI components may align with or become parts of the COE (Cognitive Orchestration Engine) in AIVA’s biology layer.
