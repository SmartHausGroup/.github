# VFE — Verbum Field Engine

**GPU-first LLM inference engine**

Part of the **TAI** archetype. [← Back to TAI](../README.md)

## Role

VFE (Verbum Field Engine) provides GPU-first LLM inference. It maintains an expandable model registry so TAI is not locked to a single provider and supports any AI model.

## Integration

- **TAI** — Primary inference engine for the personal assistant
- **RFS** — Can use RFS for context and memory
- **MAIA / VEE** — Attention and intent pipelines

Some TAI components may align with or become parts of the COE (Cognitive Orchestration Engine) in AIVA’s biology layer.
