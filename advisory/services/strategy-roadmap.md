# AI Strategy & Roadmap

After readiness is established, this service translates assessment findings into a prioritized, investment-ready roadmap.

## Who This Service Is For

- Organizations with AI readiness signals and identified opportunity set
- Leadership teams needing clarity on what to fund first
- Teams requiring a realistic 12–36 month view with budget discipline

## Core Outcomes

### Strategic Direction

A clear articulation of what AI should support in the business, and what remains outside scope.

### Prioritized Opportunity Portfolio

Short list of high-confidence initiatives ranked by value, feasibility, and risk.

### Evidence-Based Business Cases

Documented assumptions and scenarios that support each initiative.

### Implementation Architecture

Deployment dependencies, resources, and sequencing needed to execute reliably.

## Deliverables

- Strategy pack with governance and execution structure
- Prioritized portfolio with measurable milestones
- Implementation plan with stage gates
- Financial framing with assumptions and confidence bounds

## Engagement Rhythm

1. Discovery and context alignment
2. Initiative evaluation and quantification
3. Governance design and architecture framing
4. Executive review and strategy handoff

## Why It Matters

Without a roadmap, AI investments often become disconnected pilots and ad hoc spending.

This engagement aligns technical opportunities to business priorities and creates a defensible execution plan for leadership and finance teams.
