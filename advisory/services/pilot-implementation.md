# AI Pilot Implementation

A focused advisory-supported pilot validates whether a selected AI use case works in your environment before full deployment.

## Who This Service Is For

- Organizations with a defined initiative and clear ownership
- Teams that need confidence before scaling to broad deployment
- Leadership that wants objective go/no-go criteria

## Core Outcomes

### Pilot Design

Success criteria, scope, baseline metrics, and measurement plan are set up-front.

### Controlled Validation

Pilot execution with structured monitoring of performance, adoption, and risk.

### Go/No-Go Recommendation

Recommendation is explicitly tied to predefined thresholds and evidence.

### Deployment Readiness

If results support scaling, a deployment plan identifies what must be preserved from the pilot.

## What We Deliver

- Pilot design documentation
- Weekly performance updates
- Final pilot report with outcome interpretation
- Updated business case and execution recommendations

## Why It Helps

Pilots should reduce uncertainty—not create it.

Structured pilot design and explicit criteria make the outcome actionable and auditable:

- proceed with high confidence
- revise and re-test
- or pause before incurring larger deployment risk

## Delivery Phases

1. Design and success-criteria lock
2. Execution with monitoring and weekly checkpoints
3. Measurement and decision review
4. Deployment recommendation and next-step planning
