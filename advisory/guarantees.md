# Mathematical Guarantees

SMARTHAUS advisory applies a formal methodology so clients can trust that recommendations are testable, explainable, and repeatable.

## What “Guarantees” Mean in Practice

Guarantees are not marketing language. They are operating standards we apply to every advisory engagement:

- **Defined intent** before work begins
- **Formalized expectations** for inputs, outputs, and constraints
- **Repeatable evaluation** with measurable criteria
- **Auditability** through documented decisions and change logs

## Governing Principles

### Deterministic Decision Process

For each decision point, the same inputs, constraints, and context produce the same recommendations and priorities.

### Explicit State and Scope

Each engagement scope is explicit:

- what is in scope
- what is explicitly out of scope
- what assumptions can change scope

### Fail-Closed Safety

If confidence thresholds are not met, we pause and re-scope rather than proceeding with unknowns.

### Schema and Quality Guardrails

Outputs are validated before delivery to ensure:

- consistent format
- complete inputs and evidence
- clear confidence levels
- measurable owners for each outcome

### Bounded Risk

Operational and budget risks are made explicit with upper bounds, including what can and cannot be guaranteed.

### Auditability

Every recommendation is traceable:

- who provided the evidence
- what assumption supported the recommendation
- what constraint was applied
- what outcome confirms success

## Why Clients Use This Approach

The result is advisory work that supports decision-making:

- fewer failed first projects
- clearer executive alignment
- predictable checkpoints before expanding spend
- defensible rationale for board and leadership review

## What We Do Not Promise

We do not promise “future-proof” outcomes or zero risk.

We promise explicit criteria, measurable checkpoints, and the ability to re-open decisions when the evidence changes.
