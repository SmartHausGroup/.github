# Resonant Field Storage (RFS)

**A Holographic Memory Substrate for Intelligent Systems**

Resonant Field Storage (RFS) is a revolutionary approach to information storage and retrieval that treats memory as a mathematical field rather than a database. Instead of storing documents in tables and building indexes, RFS stores everything as superposed wave patterns in a shared 4-dimensional field and retrieves information through resonance.

## What Makes RFS Different?

### Traditional Systems
- Documents stored separately
- Indexes built separately
- Relationships must be explicitly defined
- Black-box search results
- No explainability

### RFS Approach
- All documents superposed in one field
- Relationships emerge automatically through interference
- Resonance-based retrieval (not keyword matching)
- Explainable results with interference patterns
- Mathematical guarantees for correctness

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Superposition
All documents are stored together in a single 4D field (x, y, z, t). This means:
- **Space Efficiency**: N documents stored in O(D) space, not O(N)
- **Automatic Relationships**: Documents interact and create interference patterns
- **Unified Storage**: One field, not separate indexes

### 2. Resonance Search
Queries work by exciting resonances in the field:
- **Semantic Matching**: Finds meaning, not just keywords
- **Fast Retrieval**: Parallel FFT operations enable rapid search
- **Relationship Discovery**: Automatically finds related documents

### 3. Interference Patterns
Wave interference reveals information:
- **Constructive Interference**: Documents that reinforce each other (relationships)
- **Destructive Interference**: Documents that contradict (tensions)
- **Explainability**: Interference patterns explain why results were returned

### 4. Exact Recall
AEAD-backed byte channel ensures:
- **Perfect Reconstruction**: Exact bytes recovered, not approximations
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic guarantees for authenticity
- **Audit Trail**: Complete provenance for compliance

### 5. Mathematical Guarantees
Every operation is mathematically proven:
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Energy Conservation**: All operations preserve mathematical properties
- **Validated Invariants**: 42+ invariants validated in continuous integration

## Use Cases

RFS excels in scenarios where relationships, explainability, and exact recall matter:

1. **Incident Memory for On-Call Teams** - Automatically discover related incidents and patterns
2. **RAG with Proofs** - Explainable document selection for LLM context
3. **Code Intelligence** - Find code analogies and patterns automatically
4. **Compliance/Legal Archive** - Audit-ready document relationships with exact recall
5. **Research Knowledge Graph** - Track concept evolution and research communities

See [Use Cases](./use-cases/) for detailed documentation on each scenario.

## Key Benefits
