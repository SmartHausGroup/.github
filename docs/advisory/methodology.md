# Mathematical Autopsy

Mathematical Autopsy (MA) is SMARTHAUS' advisory methodology for delivering AI with traceable certainty. It is grounded in explicit problem definition, formal planning, and verifiable outcomes.

## Positioning

AI work succeeds when teams can move from uncertainty to proof:

- unclear assumptions become explicit,
- informal goals become measurable,
- ad hoc decisions become repeatable,
- and outcomes become auditable.

MA is the framework we use across advisory engagements to do exactly that.

## Five Phases

### 1) Intent

We define what success means before doing any implementation.

- Business context and constraints
- Stakeholders and decision owners
- Outcomes and failure modes that matter
- Success criteria and stop conditions

### 2) Mathematical Foundation

We convert the intent into formal structure:

- Clear definitions of inputs and expected outputs
- Measurable acceptance criteria
- Assumptions and boundaries of scope
- Dependencies and risk controls

### 3) Lemmas and Guarantees

We map the formal model to practical guarantees that the advisory team can validate:

- Scope and quality rules
- Governance and reliability requirements
- Traceability from recommendations to evidence
- Explicit handoff criteria for each phase

### 4) Verification

Each engagement uses evidence-based checkpoints:

- Assessment outputs are checked against stated criteria.
- Strategy recommendations are tested against operational and business constraints.
- Pilot outcomes are measured against pre-defined thresholds.

### 5) CI-Style Discipline

We treat advisory outputs with the same rigor as production systems:

- Clear documentation of what was decided.
- Re-check conditions when assumptions change.
- Structured progression between phases.

## Evidence-Based Delivery

MA does not guarantee certainty in place of judgment; it guarantees that judgment is made with explicit, reviewable logic.

## Why This Matters for Clients

The advisory model gives organizations:

- Confidence in **what to do next**.
- Clarity on **what not to do**.
- A reliable way to compare options before major investment.
- A pathway to pilot decisions that reduce downstream failure risk.
