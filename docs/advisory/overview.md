# Advisory Practice Overview

SMARTHAUS advisory supports organizations moving from AI ambiguity to dependable execution.

We focus on organizations that need practical decisions, not hype:

- **Assess readiness** before investing
- **Prioritize opportunities** with quantified business impact
- **Pilot responsibly** with explicit success criteria
- **Guide ongoing execution** through measurable milestones

## Core Practice Principles

### 1) Readiness Before Investment

AI works better when scope, data, governance, and adoption realities are explicit.

- We define what “success” means before work starts.
- We test assumptions before committing capital.
- We sequence initiatives from highest confidence to highest leverage.

### 2) Evidence Over Intuition

Recommendations are built from observable evidence and repeatable criteria:

- stakeholder interviews and process observation
- quantified baselines
- documented scoring and weighting
- explicit success/failure thresholds

### 3) Deterministic Delivery

Our advisory workflow is designed to reduce uncertainty through explicit rules and checkpoints.

- each engagement has defined inputs, outputs, and stage gates
- each decision is tied to a documented rationale
- each milestone is measurable before the next phase starts

## Why This Matters

Most AI initiatives fail because teams start with tools and pilots, not operating model.

Advisory-first sequencing lowers waste by ensuring each phase proves value before moving forward.
