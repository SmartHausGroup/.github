# Express Assessment

An accelerated advisory engagement for organizations that need a quick, defensible AI readiness signal before deeper planning.

## Who It Is For

- Organizations with 10–100 employees
- Teams that need immediate clarity on AI opportunities
- Leadership teams evaluating next steps before committing to broader strategy work

## Purpose

Express Assessment creates a professional readiness signal in days, not weeks:

- quantify current readiness across key operating dimensions
- identify 3–5 high-probability opportunities
- define 30-day actions with clear owners
- provide an evidence-based decision point for deeper advisory

## What You Receive

- Readiness score and opportunity ranking
- Quick wins report with near-term impact
- Action plan for the next 30 days
- Live strategy call to review findings

## Typical Timeline

- Discovery questionnaire and baseline input
- Data and process review
- Analysis and interpretation
- Strategy discussion
- Delivery of decision-ready summary

## Why It Helps

- avoids expensive blind pilots
- establishes a clear starting point for advisory planning
- reduces confusion between “interesting idea” and “good initiative”
- provides a low-friction path toward a full readiness assessment

## Engagement Rhythm

1. Complete assessment intake and document upload
2. Review organizational context and current constraints
3. Prioritize opportunities by expected value and readiness
4. Deliver clear recommendation and next step

The output is intentionally short, practical, and ready for executive review.
