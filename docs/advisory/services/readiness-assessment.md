# AI Readiness Assessment

The AI Readiness Assessment helps leadership teams determine whether they should proceed with AI investment—and how.

## Who This Service Is For

- Organizations that are considering AI but have not yet aligned on scope
- Leaders evaluating whether current data, process, and governance practices can support AI
- Teams that need objective criteria before funding larger AI initiatives

## Core Outcomes

### Readiness Score

A structured score and diagnostic profile across strategy, data, operations, technology, and governance.

### Opportunity Prioritization

A ranked list of AI opportunities with quantified business impact and complexity.

### Foundation Plan

A practical remediation sequence so teams can raise readiness and reduce downstream waste.

### Board-Ready Communication

Executive-oriented summary suitable for investment discussion and steering decisions.

## What We Deliver

- 7-dimension assessment view
- Opportunity map and priority ranking
- Practical remediation roadmap
- 30-day action plan for immediate progress

## Decision Guidance

The assessment identifies whether an organization should:

- proceed now
- proceed selectively with conditions
- pause and invest in readiness first

That decision framing lowers the chance of avoidable implementation failure.

## Delivery Highlights

- Clear evidence standards for each finding
- Explicit assumptions and confidence levels
- Milestone-based recommendations before implementation

## Why It Matters

An unready organization often spends on pilot or tooling before it is ready to absorb results.

This assessment reduces waste by aligning strategy, process, and risk posture before the first major build or deployment.
