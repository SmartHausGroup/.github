# SMARTHAUS Documentation

**Advisory-first, research-driven deterministic AI through mathematics.** We help teams move from non-deterministic AI to provably reliable systems.

Welcome to the **SMARTHAUS** documentation. This site is the technical companion to [smarthaus.ai](https://smarthaus.ai).

## What is SMARTHAUS?

SMARTHAUS is an advisory and research organization.  
Our advisory practice is ready. Our products and research programs are what we are building.

### The Problem

Most AI work is non-deterministic. It produces plausible outcomes, but not guaranteed outcomes.

### The Solution

We enforce deterministic behavior through mathematics.  
That means we define the objective in math, prove guarantees, and build systems only after proofs are in place.

### The Method

Our method is the **Mathematical Autopsy (MA)** process and our core thesis that mathematics is the nervous system of AI.

## Advisory first, products in development

- **Advisory**: Strategic assessments, readiness guidance, and deterministic AI roadmaps.
- **Research**: Math-first exploration into methods and systems that reduce uncertainty.
- **Products**: TAI, AIVA, MGE, RFS, and related systems currently under active development.

## How these docs are organized

We ordered the sidebar to match a single path: **who we are → why we do this → what it’s built on → how we validate it → what we build.**

1. **Getting started** — Start here ([Intro](/)) and [About](about) for who we are.
2. **Core Thesis** — The [core thesis](thesis/framework) explains *why*: mathematics as the nervous system of AI (field theory, invariants, benchmarks).
3. **Resonant Field Storage (RFS)** — The [overview](rfs/overview), [field theory](rfs/field-theory), and [use cases](rfs/use-cases/overview) describe the memory substrate everything else builds on.
4. **Methodology** — [Mathematical Autopsy (MA)](mathematical-autopsy/overview) is how we stress-test and validate the math.
5. **Advisory** — [Practice](advisory/overview), [methodology](advisory/methodology), and service offerings for client-ready guidance.
6. **Archetypes** — What we build on top: [TAI](archetypes/tai) (personal assistant), [AIVA](archetypes/aiva) (system-building intelligence), [MGE](archetypes/mge) (governance rules engine).
