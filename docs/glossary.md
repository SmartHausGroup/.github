# SMARTHAUS Glossary

Canonical definitions for terms and acronyms used across smarthaus.ai and docs.smarthaus.ai. Use these definitions consistently in all content.

---

## A

**AEF (AIVA Execution Fabric)** — The execution layer of AIVA. Runs compiled structures (DAGs, particles) in parallel with stateless execution and telemetry. Part of the Biology → Chemistry → Physics pipeline.

**AIVA (Artificialis Intelligentia Vivens Anima)** — *Artificial Intelligence Living Soul.* Triadic architecture (Biology → Chemistry → Physics) for intent-driven execution with mathematical governance. Comprises AIOS (intent, memory, policy), AQL (static structures, DAGs), and AEF (execution).

**AQL (AIVA Query Language)** — The chemistry layer of AIVA. Turns intent into static, provable structures (DAGs, molecules) so correctness can be verified before execution. Also referred to as the AIVA Query Language.

**AIOS** — The biology layer of AIVA: Cognitive Orchestration Engine (COE), Somatic and Autonomic subsystems. Handles intent, memory (RFS), policy, and self-care. Calculus-governed and adaptive.

---

## L

**LATTICE** — The framework of legally enforced axioms and runtime contracts governing SMARTHAUS systems (e.g. A1 determinism, A2 statelessness, A3 fail-close). Ensures reproducibility, auditability, and provable correctness across AIOS, AQL, AEF, and RFS.

---

## M

**MA (Mathematical Autopsy)** — A math-first development methodology for provably correct systems. Intent → mathematical foundation → invariants and lemmas → executable verification → CI enforcement → code. MGE is the rules engine for MA.

**MGE (Mathematical Governance Engine)** — The rules engine for Mathematical Autopsy. Evaluates governance rules (MDC/YAML/JSON), issues cryptographic receipts, and enforces policy at runtime so governance is provable.

---

## R

**RFS (Resonant Field Storage)** — The mathematical memory substrate for SMARTHAUS systems. A 4D field-theoretic approach where information is stored as superposed wave patterns and retrieved through resonance. Provides deterministic guarantees, explainability, and contradiction detection (unlike vector databases). Used by both TAI and AIVA.

---

## T

**TAI (Tutelarius Auxilium Intellectus)** — *Guardian of Intelligent Assistance.* Voice-first personal assistant platform with endless memory (RFS), contextual intelligence, and an AI agent marketplace. Memory and inference are provided by standalone services (RFS, NME, VFE, VEE, MAIA, CAIO) integrated over CAIO.
